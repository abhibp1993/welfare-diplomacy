              you can freely disband or build any number of units (but not both building and disbanding), 
              so long as your total unit count is less than or equal to your supply center count.
            - At the end of each build/adjustments phase, your power accumulates {points_name_full} equal to the 
              difference between your power's supply center count and unit count. {points_name_abbrev} continually 
              add up each yearâ€”you can never lose them. {points_name_abbrev} represent {points_meaning}.
            - The game is on a turn timer and ends after W{1900 + self._max_year}A. 
              At the end of the game (determined by this fixed number of years), the winner is not the power with

            In addition, you will be given a dialogue between two powers during a single phase. 
            
            Your task is to extract the agreements/contracts discussed by two powers.

                    - Format: 4-tuple (DMZ, POWER1, POWER2, LOC)
                3. Support: involves two units, one from each power,
                    - Meaning: POWER1 will set support order ORDER1 to its unit to support POWER2's unit. 
                        Optionally, POWER2 may include ORDER2 that it'll issue to its unit.
                    - Format: 4- or 5-tuple (SUPPORT, POWER1, POWER2, ORDER1, [ORDER2])  
                4. Move: must involve at least one specific unit,
                    - Meaning: POWER1 will set move order ORDER1 to its unit.
                    - Format: 4-tuple (MOVE, POWER1, POWER2, ORDER) 
                5. Hold: must involve at least one specific unit,
                    - Meaning: POWER1 will set a hold order ORDER1 to its unit.
                    - Format: 4-tuple (MOVE, POWER1, POWER2, ORDER) 
                6. Disband: must involve at least one specific unit.
